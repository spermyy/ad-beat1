        <p>Daniel Manarang, I live in Macabebe, Pampanga. My hobbies are playing basketball and mobile games and cooking. My favorite food is Filipino food like Lumpiang Sariwa And Ginisang Ampalaya. I like a lot of vegetable food. Other things that I can tell you about me is I like watching movies/series and listening to music.
